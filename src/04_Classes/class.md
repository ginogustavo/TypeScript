# Objects:

The things you work with in code: Data structures, methods, etc

# Classes:

Blueprint for objects. They allow us to define how objects should look like, which data they should hold.

We can easily build objects based on this classes. These objects are then called `instances` of the classes. To replicate objets with the same structure, properties, methods, etc.

# Why Classes

- Define how objects should look like.
- Classes exist to speed up the creation of objects and it's simply and alternative to using objects' literal notation.
- Objects will only differ in the exact data details
