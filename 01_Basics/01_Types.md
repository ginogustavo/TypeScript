# Core Types

- number: 1, 5.3, -10
  (no difference between integer or floats)
- string: text
- boolean: true/false (just these 2, not truthy or falsy values)

They Key difference: JS uses "dynamic types" (resolved at runtime), TypeScript uses "static types"(set during development)

In JS & TS, all numbers are float by default: 5 == 5.0
