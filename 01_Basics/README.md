### TypeScript

-Adds Types: which we have to be more explicit about how things work and avoi unexpected and unnecesary errors by using types
-Next-gen JS features (compiled down for older browsers): 
-Non-JS features like Interfaces or Generics
-Meta-Programming Features like Decorators
-Rich Configuration Options
-Modern Tooling that helps even in non-TypeScript Projects
